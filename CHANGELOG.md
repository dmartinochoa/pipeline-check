# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Attack chains engine** — new `pipeline_check.core.chains` module with
  eight rules (`AC-001`..`AC-008`) that correlate individual findings into
  higher-signal attack paths (fork-PR credential theft, injection to
  unprotected deploy, unpinned action to credentials, self-hosted runner
  foothold, unsigned artifact to prod, cache poisoning, IAM privesc via
  CodeBuild, dependency confusion window).
- **Google Cloud Build expansion** — six additional checks (`GCB-010`..
  `GCB-015`) covering remote-script execution, TLS bypass, literal secrets,
  package source integrity, logging-disabled, and SBOM generation.
- **SARIF reporter** (`--output sarif`) — emits SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub
  Code Scanning and other SARIF-aware tools.
- **`pipeline_check init`** — scaffolds a starter `.pipeline-check.yml`
  config with sensible defaults.
- **CodeQL workflow** and CI badges in the README.

### Changed

- `core/checks/base.py` refactored into smaller modules (`blob.py`,
  `tokens.py`, `_primitives/`) to reduce duplication across providers.
- `release.yml` now verifies the tag matches the built wheel version
  before uploading artifacts, failing early on version drift.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-17

First public release. Expands provider and standard coverage, adds two new
reporters, and hardens the HTML output for use in PR review workflows.

### Added

- **Google Cloud Build provider** — parses `cloudbuild.yaml`; ships 9 checks
  (`GCB-001`..`GCB-009`) covering step image pinning, secret handling, and
  substitution-variable injection.
- **Jenkins provider** — parses Declarative and Scripted `Jenkinsfile`s;
  ships 31 checks (`JF-001`..`JF-031`).
- **Terraform shift-left** — runs AWS-parity checks against
  `terraform show -json` plans before provisioning.
- **CloudFormation shift-left** — ~63 AWS-parity checks against YAML/JSON
  templates with `!Ref` / `!Sub` / `!GetAtt` intrinsic handling.
- **JUnit XML reporter** (`--output junit`) — groups findings into one
  `<testsuite>` per rule prefix so Jenkins / GitLab / Azure / CircleCI /
  GitHub Actions render them as native test rows.
- **Markdown reporter** (`--output markdown`) — GFM-compatible output for
  `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` and PR / MR comment bots. Failures table + passing
  checks collapsed in `<details>`.
- **Compliance standards** expanded from 3 to 13, including SLSA Build
  Track 1.0, NIST SSDF v1.1, NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, CIS Software Supply
  Chain 1.0, CIS AWS Foundations 3.0.0, PCI DSS v4.0, and NSA/CISA ESF
  Supply Chain.
- **`--standard-report`** CLI flag emits the control-to-check matrix for a
  standard, including gaps (controls with no mapped checks).
- **`--inventory`** / `--inventory-type` / `--inventory-only` — emit a
  scanned-component inventory alongside (or instead of) findings for
  asset-register and drift-detection use cases.
- **HTML reporter interactivity** — sticky filter bar, filter state
  round-tripped via URL query params, deep-link anchors with flash
  highlight, expand/collapse-all buttons, print stylesheet, keyboard
  shortcuts (`/` focuses filter, `Escape` clears it), and OS-aware theme
  toggle persisted to `localStorage`.
- **Provider HTML filter map** now covers every rule family
  (`GCB`, `CFN`, `SIGN`, `LMB`, `CA`, `CCM`, `CWL`, `KMS`, `SSM`, `EB`, …)
  so new checks don't silently collapse into an "other" bucket.
- **LocalStack integration test** pinned to 3.8 with a Terraform fixture,
  exercised in CI.
- **Dogfooding workflow** runs `pipeline_check` against its own
  `.github/workflows/` on every push.

### Changed

- **Rule counts** grew across every CI provider — GHA 27→29, GL 25→30,
  BB 25→27, ADO 26→28, JF 29→31, CC 26→30; AWS total 70→72.
- **SARIF reporter** now splits standard slugs into rule-level
  `properties.tags` (for GitHub code-scanning filters) and individual
  control IDs into per-result `properties.controls` (structured). This
  keeps rule tags under GitHub's 20-tag cap and lets kebab-case IDs
  (`Dangerous-Workflow`) round-trip cleanly.
- **CLI help text** uses ASCII fallbacks (`->`, `>=`) instead of `→` / `≥`
  so Windows `cmd.exe` (cp1252) can render `--help` without
  `UnicodeEncodeError`.

### Fixed

- **CLI stdio on Windows** — stdout / stderr are reconfigured with
  `errors="replace"` at import time so un-encodable characters degrade to
  `?` instead of crashing the process on legacy consoles.
- **HTML reporter** provider-prefix map no longer drops `GCB`, `CFN`,
  `SIGN`, `LMB`, `CA`, `CCM`, `CWL`, `KMS`, `SSM`, `EB`, `CW` — previously
  these collapsed to "other" and were unreachable from the Provider
  filter.
