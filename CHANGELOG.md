## [Unreleased]

PRs landing on `dev` between releases append entries below. The
release commit collapses this section into `## [X.Y.Z] - <date>`.

### Added

- GitHub issue templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`: bug report,
  feature request, and a dedicated false-positive form that requires
  `check_id` plus a minimal repro YAML.
- **Per-rule unit tests for the five CI providers** following the
  ``tests/<provider>/conftest.py`` + per-area-module pattern. As of
  this release, rule-test coverage by provider:
    - GitHub Actions: 17/33 (52%)
    - GitLab: 18/31 (58%)
    - Bitbucket: 16/28 (57%)
    - CircleCI: 15/31 (48%)
    - Jenkins: 12/31 (39%)
    - Cloud Build: 18/18 (100%, full)
    - Kubernetes: 4/26 (the K8S-023..026 additions)
    - Dockerfile: 2/16 (the DF-015..016 additions)
    - Azure: 6/29 (existing tests only — no new modules)
  Test modules are split by area: pinning, secrets-and-creds,
  runtime-hardening, supply-chain. Each conftest exposes a
  ``run_check(snippet, check_id)`` helper that runs the orchestrator
  against an inline YAML/Groovy snippet and returns the matching
  ``Finding``.
- **Rule-coverage meta-test** at ``tests/test_rule_test_coverage.py``
  locks the per-provider floors above to prevent regressions: a new
  rule landing without a ``class Test<RULE_ID>...`` will dip the
  floor and fail this guard. Bumping the floor in the file is the
  documented way to record backfill progress.
- **13 new autofixers** for Kubernetes and Cloud Build, lifting the
  catalog from 68 to 81. K8s: drop-line fixers for `K8S-002`/`-003`/
  `-004`/`-005` (`hostNetwork`, `hostPID`, `hostIPC`, `privileged:
  true`); flip-value fixers for `K8S-006`/`-007`/`-008` (flip
  `allowPrivilegeEscalation`, `runAsNonRoot`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem`
  to the safe value while preserving inline comments); comment-only
  TODOs for `K8S-013` (`hostPath` volumes) and `K8S-020`
  (`cluster-admin` / `system:masters` bindings). Cloud Build: insert
  top-level `timeout: '600s'` for `GCB-005`, drop `logging: NONE`
  for `GCB-014`, comment-only TODO above unpinned step images for
  `GCB-001`, plus shared TLS-bypass mitigation for `GCB-011`.
- **Two new attack chains.** `AC-009` Supply Chain Repo Poisoning
  fires when GHA-001 (unpinned action), GHA-002 (script-injection
  sink), and GHA-008 (literal secrets in YAML) all hit the same
  workflow file. `AC-010` Self-Hosted Runner Environment Exfiltration
  fires when GHA-012 (non-ephemeral self-hosted runner) coincides
  with GHA-016 (curl-pipe) or GHA-019 (token persistence) on the
  same workflow. Both are CRITICAL, mapped to MITRE T1195.002 +
  T1078.004 + T1552.001 as appropriate. Chain catalog goes from 8
  to 10.
- **Four new Kubernetes rules.** `K8S-023` flags Namespaces missing a
  `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce` label set to baseline or
  restricted (kube-system, kube-public, kube-node-lease are exempt).
  `K8S-024` flags long-running containers without a livenessProbe
  or readinessProbe (Jobs and CronJobs are exempt because their
  lifecycle signal is completion, not health). `K8S-025` flags
  workloads outside `kube-system` that claim `system-cluster-critical`
  or `system-node-critical` priority — those classes give the right
  to evict every non-system pod on the cluster. `K8S-026` flags
  Services of type LoadBalancer that don't set
  `spec.loadBalancerSourceRanges`, which is the cloud-portable way
  to cap an external LB at known client CIDRs. K8s rule catalog
  goes from 22 to 26.
- **Two new Dockerfile rules.** `DF-015` flags `RUN` instructions
  that grant world-writable permissions (`chmod 777`, `chmod 0777`,
  `chmod a+w`, `chmod a+rwx`, `chmod ugo+w`). World-writable
  directories under `/` are an established container-escape vector.
  `DF-016` flags images that don't declare both
  `org.opencontainers.image.source` and
  `org.opencontainers.image.revision` LABELs. The two annotations
  are the de-facto OCI provenance standard; without them a pulled
  image can't be traced back to a source revision during incident
  response. Dockerfile rule catalog goes from 14 to 16.
- **Three new Cloud Build rules.** `GCB-016` flags step `dir:`
  fields that traverse out of `/workspace` via `..` (path-escape
  into the builder image filesystem). `GCB-017` flags
  image-producing builds that don't set
  `options.requestedVerifyOption: VERIFIED`, which is how Cloud
  Build emits signed SLSA provenance attestations alongside the
  pushed image; aligns with SLSA Build Level 2. `GCB-018` flags
  the legacy KMS-encrypted top-level `secrets:` block in favor
  of `availableSecrets` + Secret Manager (which rotates without
  re-committing ciphertext and produces explicit audit-log
  entries on every read). Cloud Build rule catalog goes from 15
  to 18.

### Changed

- **CIS AWS Foundations standard mappings densified.** Added
  `1.14` (key rotation), `3.2` (CloudTrail log file validation),
  `3.7` (CloudTrail logs encrypted with KMS) to the controls
  table. Mapped `IAM-007`, `KMS-001`, `KMS-002`, `CT-001..003`,
  `CWL-001..002`, and `ECR-007` into the appropriate CIS
  controls. The `cis_aws_foundations` mapping nearly doubled in
  scope.
- **NIST 800-53 standard mappings densified.** Added `AU-11`
  (Audit Record Retention) to the controls table. Added
  mappings for the previously-uncovered Cloud Build (GCB-001
  through GCB-018), Kubernetes (K8S-001 through K8S-026),
  Dockerfile (DF-001 through DF-016), Jenkins (selected JF-*),
  and the missing AWS services (KMS, CT, CWL, CW, SM, SSM,
  SIGN, LMB, EB, CCM, CA). The `nist_800_53` mapping size grew
  from ~150 lines to ~250.
- OWASP CI/CD Top 10 mappings extended for new GCB-010..018,
  K8S-023..026, and the previously-unmapped Dockerfile rules
  (DF-001..016) so the cross-standards integrity check passes.
- `docs/index.md` wordmark and the inline terminal animation now
  read the version from `pipeline_check.__version__` via a mkdocs
  hook (`hooks/mkdocs_version.py`). The hardcoded `v0.3.0` and
  `v0.3.3` literals had drifted across release cycles.

### Fixed

- Reporter and gate function signatures (`report_terminal`,
  `report_json`, `report_html`, `report_sarif`, `report_junit`,
  `report_markdown`, `evaluate_gate`) now accept the actual
  `ScoreResult` `TypedDict` from `core.scorer` instead of an
  unparameterised `dict`. Closes a real type-inference gap that
  mypy was flagging in `cli.py` lines 1517–1617 and unblocks part
  of the eventual strict-mode flip.
- `GCB-018` rule narrowing: replaced the boolean-flag pattern with
  direct `isinstance(legacy, list) and legacy` so mypy narrows
  `legacy` to a list before iteration. The runtime behavior is
  unchanged; the type checker now agrees with the code.
- `cli.py` `--explain-chain` and `--standard-report` paths used
  variable names that collided with outer-scope loop variables
  of incompatible types. Renamed locally so mypy can narrow them
  cleanly without changing user-visible behavior.
- **mypy lax-mode is now clean** (80 errors -> 0). Closed the
  remaining ~50 real type bugs across `_secrets.py` (label reuse
  widening), `_iam_policy.py` (json.loads narrowing), gl004 (bool
  cast), cloudformation/services.py (env_vars annotation),
  autofix.py:1398 (regex slice), cloudformation/s3.py:_target_key
  (Ref/GetAtt narrowing), terraform/phase3.py (nested branches
  narrowing), lambda_handler (s3_key widening),
  providers/aws.py (s3 client narrowing), iam007_key_age
  (isinstance(datetime)), aws/_catalog.py (result tuple type),
  github/base.py (YAML 1.1 ``on``->``True`` cast),
  cloudformation/base.py (is_intrinsic + Sub return-type narrowing),
  jenkins/rules/_helpers.py (Match[str] generic).
- yaml-stub spam silenced via `disable_error_code = ["import-untyped"]`
  in `pyproject.toml` plus `types-PyYAML` added to `requirements-dev.in`
  (next pip-compile cycle will lock it in).
- AWS-leaning modules covered by a per-module mypy override
  (boto3's untyped responses produce ~22 near-identical errors;
  the documented escape hatch until `boto3-stubs` is adopted).
- **`continue-on-error: true` removed from `.github/workflows/python-app.yml`.**
  mypy is now a required CI gate. Strict mode (`strict = true`)
  remains a follow-up PR (~400 strict-only errors across rule
  modules).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-06

### Changed

- **GitHub Actions workflow audit.** `pypi-publish.yml` was duplicating
  `release.yml`'s tag-push behavior without the version-vs-wheel
  guard, which is the failure mode that produced the v0.3.1 mess.
  Auto-trigger removed; it stays as a manual-only fallback path with
  its own pyproject-version check. `docs.yml` and `pypi-publish.yml`
  checkout steps now set `persist-credentials: false` (GHA-002).
  `localstack-test.yml` pins LocalStack Pro to `:3` instead of
  `:latest` so a major-version bump can't surprise CI.
- README now uses `pipeline_check` long_description's logo URL pinned
  to the absolute `raw.githubusercontent.com` path. The relative
  `docs/logo.png` no longer rendered on PyPI after MANIFEST.in
  pruned `docs/` from the sdist.

### Fixed

- Removed dead-code import block in `tests/test_doc_claims.py`
  (`_count_awslike_checks` was never called and the imports were
  flagged by ruff F401 in CI on Windows).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-06

0.3.1 was tagged but the version-vs-tag guard caught that the bump
commit hadn't been merged. Re-cut as 0.3.2 with the bump on master.

### Added

- **Kubernetes manifest provider.** Parses K8s API documents
  (`Deployment`, `Pod`, `Job`, `CronJob`, `DaemonSet`, `StatefulSet`,
  `ReplicaSet`, `Service`, `Secret`, `Role`, `ClusterRole`,
  `RoleBinding`, `ClusterRoleBinding`) from YAML on disk. Multi-doc
  files and directories of manifests both work. Helm `values.yaml`,
  `Chart.yaml`, and kustomization files are silently skipped. New
  CLI flag `--k8s-path`, auto-detection of `kubernetes/`, `k8s/`,
  or `manifests/` at cwd. 22 checks (`K8S-001`..`K8S-022`) covering:
  image digest pinning, host-namespace sharing
  (`hostNetwork`/`hostPID`/`hostIPC`), `securityContext`
  (`privileged`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation`, `runAsNonRoot`,
  `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, capabilities, seccompProfile),
  service-account hygiene, `automountServiceAccountToken`,
  `hostPath` volumes (with a sensitive-path upgrade to CRITICAL for
  `docker.sock`, `/var/lib/kubelet`, `/etc`, `/`), resource limits,
  env-var and Secret credential leakage (with base64-decoded scans
  of `Secret.data`), default-namespace placement,
  ClusterRoleBinding to `cluster-admin` or `system:masters`,
  wildcard verbs+resources in Roles/ClusterRoles, and Services
  exposing port 22 (SSH).
- **Standards coverage for Kubernetes.** Every `K8S-*` rule is
  mapped into OWASP Top 10 CI/CD and NIST SP 800-190 (Application
  Container Security).
- **MANIFEST.in.** Defense-in-depth filter on the PyPI sdist to keep
  the GitHub Pages docs site, repo tooling, and local cache
  artifacts out of releases. Ships `CHANGELOG.md` (was previously
  absent from the sdist).
- **`tests/test_doc_claims.py`.** Locks the README and
  `docs/index.md` numerical claims (providers, standards,
  autofixers, attack chains, total checks) against the live
  registries so doc drift fails CI.
- **`tests/test_english_variant.py`.** Fails the suite if a British
  spelling lands in any tracked source or doc file. Convention
  documented in `CLAUDE.md`.

### Changed

- `pyproject.toml` description now lists every supported provider.
  CloudFormation, CircleCI, Cloud Build, and Dockerfile were
  previously omitted.
- README provider table, architecture ASCII, rule-tree listing, and
  the docs site landing page reconciled against the current rule
  catalog: 430+ checks across 12 providers. Older claims of "330+
  across 10/11" replaced.
- README logo points at the absolute GitHub raw URL so the PyPI
  long_description renders the image. The relative `docs/logo.png`
  path no longer resolved on PyPI after the sdist filter pruned
  `docs/`.
- Project switched to American English throughout. Convention
  documented in `CLAUDE.md`; bulk converter lives at
  `scripts/_apply_american_english.py`; enforcement via
  `tests/test_english_variant.py`.

### Fixed

- Config file loader (`core/config._TOPLEVEL_KEYS`) now accepts
  `cloudbuild_path`, `dockerfile_path`, `cfn_template`,
  `jenkinsfile_path`, and `k8s_path`. These keys were already
  documented by `pipeline_check init`'s scaffolded template but were
  silently rejected by the strict schema validator.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Documentation site** — full MkDocs Material build deployed to
  GitHub Pages on every push to `master`. Hand-tuned landing page
  with an interactive scan-pipeline component, animated terminal,
  and brand-tinted typography across the provider, standards, and
  reference docs.
- **AWS IAM permissions reference** in `docs/providers/aws.md` —
  per-service permission map plus a copy-paste least-privilege
  IAM policy for running a full live-AWS scan, including a sample
  GitHub Actions OIDC trust policy.

### Changed

- Pinned `pymdown-extensions` to `10.21.2` to fix a fenced-code
  rendering bug present in 10.12 that mangled the language tag.
- GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/docs.yml` are now pinned to
  commit SHAs (resolved from current major-version tags).
- `LocalStack Integration Test` workflow is now manual-trigger only
  (`workflow_dispatch`); push and nightly schedule triggers removed.

### Internal

- Dependabot kept dependencies and action SHAs current across the
  release window.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Attack chains engine** — new `pipeline_check.core.chains` module with
  eight rules (`AC-001`..`AC-008`) that correlate individual findings into
  higher-signal attack paths (fork-PR credential theft, injection to
  unprotected deploy, unpinned action to credentials, self-hosted runner
  foothold, unsigned artifact to prod, cache poisoning, IAM privesc via
  CodeBuild, dependency confusion window).
- **Google Cloud Build expansion** — six additional checks (`GCB-010`..
  `GCB-015`) covering remote-script execution, TLS bypass, literal secrets,
  package source integrity, logging-disabled, and SBOM generation.
- **SARIF reporter** (`--output sarif`) — emits SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub
  Code Scanning and other SARIF-aware tools.
- **`pipeline_check init`** — scaffolds a starter `.pipeline-check.yml`
  config with sensible defaults.
- **CodeQL workflow** and CI badges in the README.

### Changed

- `core/checks/base.py` refactored into smaller modules (`blob.py`,
  `tokens.py`, `_primitives/`) to reduce duplication across providers.
- `release.yml` now verifies the tag matches the built wheel version
  before uploading artifacts, failing early on version drift.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-17

First public release. Expands provider and standard coverage, adds two new
reporters, and hardens the HTML output for use in PR review workflows.

### Added

- **Google Cloud Build provider** — parses `cloudbuild.yaml`; ships 9 checks
  (`GCB-001`..`GCB-009`) covering step image pinning, secret handling, and
  substitution-variable injection.
- **Jenkins provider** — parses Declarative and Scripted `Jenkinsfile`s;
  ships 31 checks (`JF-001`..`JF-031`).
- **Terraform shift-left** — runs AWS-parity checks against
  `terraform show -json` plans before provisioning.
- **CloudFormation shift-left** — ~63 AWS-parity checks against YAML/JSON
  templates with `!Ref` / `!Sub` / `!GetAtt` intrinsic handling.
- **JUnit XML reporter** (`--output junit`) — groups findings into one
  `<testsuite>` per rule prefix so Jenkins / GitLab / Azure / CircleCI /
  GitHub Actions render them as native test rows.
- **Markdown reporter** (`--output markdown`) — GFM-compatible output for
  `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` and PR / MR comment bots. Failures table + passing
  checks collapsed in `<details>`.
- **Compliance standards** expanded from 3 to 13, including SLSA Build
  Track 1.0, NIST SSDF v1.1, NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, CIS Software Supply
  Chain 1.0, CIS AWS Foundations 3.0.0, PCI DSS v4.0, and NSA/CISA ESF
  Supply Chain.
- **`--standard-report`** CLI flag emits the control-to-check matrix for a
  standard, including gaps (controls with no mapped checks).
- **`--inventory`** / `--inventory-type` / `--inventory-only` — emit a
  scanned-component inventory alongside (or instead of) findings for
  asset-register and drift-detection use cases.
- **HTML reporter interactivity** — sticky filter bar, filter state
  round-tripped via URL query params, deep-link anchors with flash
  highlight, expand/collapse-all buttons, print stylesheet, keyboard
  shortcuts (`/` focuses filter, `Escape` clears it), and OS-aware theme
  toggle persisted to `localStorage`.
- **Provider HTML filter map** now covers every rule family
  (`GCB`, `CFN`, `SIGN`, `LMB`, `CA`, `CCM`, `CWL`, `KMS`, `SSM`, `EB`, …)
  so new checks don't silently collapse into an "other" bucket.
- **LocalStack integration test** pinned to 3.8 with a Terraform fixture,
  exercised in CI.
- **Dogfooding workflow** runs `pipeline_check` against its own
  `.github/workflows/` on every push.

### Changed

- **Rule counts** grew across every CI provider — GHA 27→29, GL 25→30,
  BB 25→27, ADO 26→28, JF 29→31, CC 26→30; AWS total 70→72.
- **SARIF reporter** now splits standard slugs into rule-level
  `properties.tags` (for GitHub code-scanning filters) and individual
  control IDs into per-result `properties.controls` (structured). This
  keeps rule tags under GitHub's 20-tag cap and lets kebab-case IDs
  (`Dangerous-Workflow`) round-trip cleanly.
- **CLI help text** uses ASCII fallbacks (`->`, `>=`) instead of `→` / `≥`
  so Windows `cmd.exe` (cp1252) can render `--help` without
  `UnicodeEncodeError`.

### Fixed

- **CLI stdio on Windows** — stdout / stderr are reconfigured with
  `errors="replace"` at import time so un-encodable characters degrade to
  `?` instead of crashing the process on legacy consoles.
- **HTML reporter** provider-prefix map no longer drops `GCB`, `CFN`,
  `SIGN`, `LMB`, `CA`, `CCM`, `CWL`, `KMS`, `SSM`, `EB`, `CW` — previously
  these collapsed to "other" and were unreachable from the Provider
  filter.

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/dmartinochoa/pipeline-check/releases/tag/v0.2.0
